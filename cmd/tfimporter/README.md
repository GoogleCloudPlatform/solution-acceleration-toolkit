# Terraform Importer

**WARNING: This is an experimental version which does not yet support all
resources that DPT does.**

Terraform Importer is a standalone utility to import existing infrastructure
into a Terraform state, based on existing Terraform configs. Its target use-case
is to facilitate migration between other infrastructure-as-code tools (such as
[Deployment Manager](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager)), and a
planned future version of DPT that will generate Terraform configs.

## Requirements

-   [Terraform 0.12+](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
-   [Go 1.14+](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Usage

```
$ go install ./cmd/tfimporter
$ tfimporter -- --input_dir ~/path/to/terraform/configs/dir/
```

On a successful run, the Terraform configs directory will be initialized and all
supported resources will be in the state.

If you now run `terraform plan`, you should only see planned changes for
differences between the configs and the actual infrastructure.

## Supported Resources

*   [google_storage_bucket](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/storage_bucket.html)

## Terraformer

This tool is complementary to
[Terraformer](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraformer).

Terraformer focuses on generating new Terraform configs from existing
infrastructure, while the Importer allows you to define and organize your own
Terraform configs, including importing resources from within modules.
