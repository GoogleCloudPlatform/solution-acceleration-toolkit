# Continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD)

This directory defines the resources that need to be deployed manually to set up
CICD pipelines of Terraform configs.

The CI and CD pipelines use
[Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build) and
[Cloud Build triggers](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/automating-builds/create-manage-triggers)
to detect changes in the repo, trigger builds, and run the workloads.

## Setup

1. Generate the CICD Terraform configs and Cloud Build configs using the
    Terraform Engine. Only the Terraform resources in the current directory,
    that is, the `cicd/` directory under root, need to be deployed manually.

1. Before deploying CICD Terraform resources, install the Cloud Build app and
    [connect your GitHub repository](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers/connect)
    to your Cloud project by following the steps in
    [Installing the Cloud Build app](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/automating-builds/create-github-app-triggers#installing_the_cloud_build_app).
    To perform this operation, you need Admin permission in that GitHub
    repository. This can't be done through automation.

1. After the GitHub repo is connected, run the following commands in this
    directory to enable the necessary APIs, grant the Cloud Build service
    account the necessary permissions, and create Cloud Build triggers:

    ```shell
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```

## Features

### Event-triggered builds

Two presubmit and one postsubmit triggers are created by default.

* \[Presubmit\] `tf-validate`: Perform Terraform format and syntax check.
* \[Presubmit\] `tf-plan`: Generate speculative plans to show a set of
    potential changes if the pending config changes are deployed.
  * This also performs a non-blocking check for resource deletions. These
        are worth reviewing, as deletions are potentially destructive.
* \[Postsubmit\] `tf-apply`: Apply the terraform configs that are checked into
    the Github repo. This trigger is only applicable post-submit. When this
    trigger is set in the Terraform engine config, the Cloud Build service
    account is given broader permissions to be able to make changes to the
    infrastructure.

Every new push to the Pull Request at the configured branches automatically
triggers presubmit runs. To manually re-trigger CI jobs, comment `/gcbrun` in
the Pull Ruquest. Presubmit Cloud Build results are posted as a Cloud Build job
link in the Pull Request. Failures of these presubmits should be configured to
block Pull Request submissions.

The postsubmit Cloud Build job automatically starts after a Pull Ruquest is
submitted to a configured branch. To view the result of the Cloud Build run, go
to [Build history](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds) and look
for your commit to view the Cloud Build job triggered by your merged commit.

The `build_viewers` members can view detailed log output.

The triggers all use a [helper runner script](./configs/run.sh) to perform
actions. The `MODULES` var within the script lists the modules that are managed
(relative to the `terraform_root` var) by the triggers and the order they are
run.

### Scheduled builds

You can configure the triggers to be run at a specified schedule via the
`run_on_schedule` attribute in each trigger block. The schedule is defined using
the
[unix-cron format](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/configuring/cron-job-schedules#defining_the_job_schedule).
Note that to use the scheduling feature, additional attribute `scheduler_region`
must be specified under the `cicd` template. An App Engine application will be
enabled and created behind the scenes, and supported regions can be found
[here](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/locations).

### CICD for `devops` project itself

The CICD service account can manage a subset of resources (e.g. APIs) within its
own project (`devops` project). This allows users to have low risk changes made
in the `devops` project deployed through the standard Cloud Build pipelines,
without needing to apply it manually. To do so, add the `devops` module (that
hosts the devops project) in the `managed_modules` list in the CICD Terraform
Engine config block. Other changes in the `devops` project outside the approved
set (APIs) will still need to be made manually.

A common use case for this is when adding a new resource in a project that
requires a new API to be enabled. You must add the API in both the resource's
project as well as the `devops` project. With the feature above, the CICD can
deploy both changes for you.

### Deletion check allowlist

The deletion check run as part of the `tf-plan` trigger optionally accepts an
allowlist of resources to ignore, using
[grep extended regex patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#POSIX_extended)
matched against the Terraform resource **address** from the plan.

To configure an allowlist:

1. Create a file `tf-deletion-allowlist.txt` in the `cicd/configs/` directory.
2. Add patterns to it, one per line.

Example:

```text
network
^module.cloudsql.module.safer_mysql.google_sql_database.default$
google_sql_user.db_users\["user-creds"\]
```

Each line allows, respectively:

1. Any resource whose address contains the string "network".
2. A specific resource within a module.
3. A specific resource with a generated name, i.e. from `for_each` or `count`.
