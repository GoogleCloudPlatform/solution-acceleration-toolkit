# This folder contains Terraform resources to setup CI/CD, which includes:
# - Necessary APIs to enable in the devops project for CI/CD purposes,
# - Necessary IAM permissions to set to enable Cloud Build Service Account perform CI/CD jobs.
# - Cloud Build Triggers to monitor GitHub repos to start CI/CD jobs.
#
# The Cloud Build configs can be found under the configs/ sub-folder.

# ***NOTE***: First follow
# https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/automating-builds/create-github-app-triggers#installing_the_cloud_build_app
# to install the Cloud Build app and connect your GitHub repository to your Cloud project.
