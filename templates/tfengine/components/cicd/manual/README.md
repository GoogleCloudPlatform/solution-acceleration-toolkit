# Continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD)

This directory defines the resources that need to be deployed manually
to set up CICD pipelines of Terraform configs.

The CI and CD pipelines use
[Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build) and
[Cloud Build triggers](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/automating-builds/create-manage-triggers)
to detect changes in the repo, trigger builds, and run the workloads.

## Setup

1. In the Terraform Engine config, add a `CICD` block under the `foundation`
   recipe and specify the following attributes:

    * `parent_type`: Type of parent Google Cloud resource to allow CICD to manage:
        can be "organization" or "folder".
    * `parent_id`: ID of parent GCP resource to allow CICD to manage:
        can be the organization ID or folder ID according to parent_type.
    * `project_id`: Project ID of the `devops` project.
    * `state_bucket`: Name of the state bucket.
    * `github`: Configuration block for GitHub Cloud Build triggers,
      which supports:
      * `owner`: GitHub repo owner
      * `name`: GitHub repo name
    * `cloud_source_repository`: Configuration block for Google Cloud
      Source Repository Cloud Build triggers, which supports:
      * `name`: Cloud Source Repository repo name
    * `branch_regex`: Regex of the branches to set the Cloud Build Triggers to
        monitor.
    * `continuous_deployment_enabled`: Whether or not to enable continuous
        deployment of Terraform configs.
    * `trigger_enabled`: Whether or not to enable all Cloud Build triggers.
    * `deployment_trigger_enabled`: Whether or not to enable the post-submit
        Cloud Build trigger to deploy Terraform configs. This is useful when
        you want to create the Cloud Build trigger and manually run it to
        deploy Terraform configs, but don't want it to be triggered automatically
        by a push to branch. The post-submit Cloud Build trigger for deployment
        will be disabled as long as one of `trigger_enabled` or
        `deployment_trigger_enabled` is set to `false`.
    * `terraform_root`: Path of the directory relative to the repo root
        containing the Terraform configs.
    * `build_viewers`: IAM members to grant `cloudbuild.builds.viewer` role
        in the devops project to see CICD results.
    * `managed_services`: APIs to enable in the devops project so the Cloud
        Build service account can manage those services in other projects.

1. Generate the CICD Terraform configs and Cloud Build configs using the
    Terraform Engine. Only the Terraform resources in the current directory,
    that is, the `cicd/` directory under root, need to be deplopyed manually.

1. Before deploying CICD Terraform resources, install the Cloud Build app
   and connect your GitHub repository to your Cloud project by following
   the steps in
   [Installing the Cloud Build app](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/automating-builds/create-github-app-triggers#installing_the_cloud_build_app).
   To perform this operation, you need Admin permission in that
   GitHub repository. This can't be done through automation.

1. After the GitHub repo is connected, run the following commands in this
   directory to enable the necessary APIs, grant the Cloud Build service account
   the necessary permissions, and create Cloud Build triggers:

    ```shell
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```

   Two presubmit triggers are created by default. Build/test status and results
   are posted in the Pull Request. Failures of these presubmits should
   be configured to block Pull Request submissions.

   * `tf-validate`: Perform Terraform format and syntax check.
   * `tf-plan`: Generate speculative plans to show a set of potential changes
     if the pending config changes are deployed.
      * This also performs a non-blocking check for resource deletions. These are
        worth reviewing, as deletions are potentially destructive.

    If `continuous_deployment_enabled` is set to `true` in your Terraform Engine
    config, `continuous_deployment_enabled` will be set to `true` in
    [terraform.tfvars](./terraform.tfvars) to create an additional Cloud Build
    trigger and grant the Cloud Build service account broder permissions.
    After the Pull Request is approved and submitted, this postsubmit deployment
    job can automatically apply the config changes to Google Cloud.

    After the triggers are created, to temporarily disable or re-enable them,
    set the `trigger_enabled` in [terraform.tfvars](./terraform.tfvars) to
    `false` or `true` and apply the changes by running the following commands:

    ```shell
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```

## Operation

### Continuous integration (presubmit)

Presubmit Cloud Build results are posted as a Cloud Build job link in the
Pull Request. They should be configured to block Pull Request submissions.

Every new push to the Pull Request at the configured branches automatically
triggers presubmit runs. To manually re-trigger CI jobs, comment `/gcbrun` in the
Pull Ruquest.

### Deletion Check Whitelist

The deletion check optionally accepts a whitelist of resources to ignore, using
[grep extended regex patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#POSIX_extended)
matched against the Terraform resource **address** from the plan.

To configure a whitelist:

1. Create a file `tf-deletion-whitelist.txt` in the `cicd/configs/` directory.
2. Add patterns to it, one per line.

Example:

```text
network
^module.cloudsql.module.safer_mysql.google_sql_database.default$
google_sql_user.db_users\["user-creds"\]
```

Each line whitelists, respectively:

1. Any resource whose address contains the string "network".
2. A specific resource within a module.
3. A specific resource with a generated name, i.e. from `for_each` or `count`.

### Continuous deployment (postsubmit)

The postsubmit Cloud Build job automatically starts after a Pull Ruquest is
submitted to a configured branch. To view the result of the Cloud Build run, go
to [Build history](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds)
and look for your commit to view the Cloud Build job triggered by your merged
commit.

The Postsubmit Cloud Build trigger monitors and deploys changes made to the `live/`
folder only. Changes made to `bootstrap/`, `cicd/`, and other folders at
root must be deployed manually.
