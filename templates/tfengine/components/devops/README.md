# Bootstrap

This directory defines resources that must be deployed first in order for the
rest of the Terraform configs to function.

Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply` in this directory and backup the
Terraform state files manually.

Currently this only creates the central devops project. After this project has
been created, Terraform can bootstrap the state bucket inside the project and
manage all the following resources.
