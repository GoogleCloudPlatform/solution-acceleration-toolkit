            This is not recursive.

            Example:
              A foundation recipe may expect audit information to be in a field 'AUDIT'.
              Thus a user will likely write 'AUDIT: { PROJECT_ID: "foo"}' in their config.
              However, the audit template itself will look for the field 'PROJECT_ID'.
              Thus, the audit template should flatten the 'AUDIT' key.

            Keys to pass directly to a child template data.
            This is not recursive.

            Example:
              The deployment recipe expects "terraform_addons" to be passed to
              it directly, so the project recipe uses this key to do so.
          EOF
