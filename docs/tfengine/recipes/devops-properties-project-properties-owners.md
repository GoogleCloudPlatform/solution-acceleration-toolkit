# Untitled array in Devops Recipe Schema

```txt
undefined#/properties/project/properties/owners
```

            List of members to transfer ownership of the project to.
            NOTE: By default the creating user will be the owner of the project.
            Thus, there should be a group in this list and you must be part of that group,
            so a group owns the project going forward.
