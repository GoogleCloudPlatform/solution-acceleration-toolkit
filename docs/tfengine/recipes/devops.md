Group who will be given org admin access.

Type: string

### billing_account

ID of billing account to attach to this project.

Type: string

### enable_bootstrap_gcs_backend

Whether to enable GCS backend for the bootstrap deployment. Defaults to false.
Since the bootstrap deployment creates the state bucket, it cannot back the state
to the GCS bucket on the first deployment. Thus, this field should be set to true
after the bootstrap deployment has been applied. Then the user can run
`terraform init` in the bootstrapd deployment to transfer the state
from local to GCS.

Type: boolean

### parent_id

ID of parent GCP resource to apply the policy.
Can be one of the organization ID or folder ID according to parent_type.

### project

Config for the project to host devops resources such as remote state and CICD.

### project.apis

List of APIs enabled in the devops project.

NOTE: If a CICD is deployed within this project, then the APIs of
all resources managed by the CICD must be listed here
(even if the resources themselves are in different projects).

### project.owners

List of members to transfer ownership of the project to.
NOTE: By default the creating user will be the owner of the project.
Thus, there should be a group in this list and you must be part of that group,
so a group owns the project going forward.
